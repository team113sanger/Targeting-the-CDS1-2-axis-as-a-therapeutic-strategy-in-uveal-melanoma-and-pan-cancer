# Targeting the CDS1/2 Axis in Uveal Melanoma and Pan-Cancer

This repository serves as the central landing page for multiple sub-analyses related to the manuscript:

> **_Targeting the CDS1/2 axis as a therapeutic strategy in uveal melanoma and pan-cancer_**

The analyses were conducted by several authors in the Adams group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Each  sub-analysis repository linked below contains its own **README.md** with details of the methods, code, and data required for reproducing the results.
